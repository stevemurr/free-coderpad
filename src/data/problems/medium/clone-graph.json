  "description": "Given a reference of a node in a **connected undirected graph**.\n\nReturn a **deep copy** (clone) of the graph.\n\nEach node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.\n\n```\nclass Node {\n    public int val;\n    public List<Node> neighbors;\n}\n```\n\n**Test case format:**\n\nFor simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an **adjacency list**.\n\nAn **adjacency list** is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.\n\nThe given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.\n\n### Example 1\n\n**Input:** `adjList = [[2, 4], [1, 3], [2, 4], [1, 3]]`  \n**Output:** `[[2, 4], [1, 3], [2, 4], [1, 3]]`  \n**Explanation:** There are 4 nodes in the graph.\n- 1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).\n- 2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).\n- 3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).\n- 4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).",
