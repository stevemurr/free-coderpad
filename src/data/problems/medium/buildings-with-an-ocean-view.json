  "description": "There are `n` buildings in a line. You are given an integer array `heights` of size `n` that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.\n\nThe ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an **ocean view** if the building can see the ocean without being blocked by another building. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a **smaller height**.\n\nReturn a list of indices (0-indexed) of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order.\n\n### Example 1\n\n**Input:** `heights = [4, 2, 3, 1]`  \n**Output:** `[0, 2, 3]`  \n**Explanation:** Building 1 (0-indexed) does not have an ocean view because building 2 is taller.\n\n### Example 2\n\n**Input:** `heights = [4, 3, 2, 1]`  \n**Output:** `[0, 1, 2, 3]`  \n**Explanation:** All buildings have an ocean view.\n\n### Example 3\n\n**Input:** `heights = [1, 3, 2, 4]`  \n**Output:** `[3]`  \n**Explanation:** Only building 3 has an ocean view.",
